    "content": "Life Thru a Lens To see ourselves as other see us (Burns)\n \n \n\"Self Help Sir, Self Help\"\n\nThis is an un-sourced but often repeated quote from \"Self Help\" by Samuel Smiles. It could be argued that this is where the self help industry really started. Not surprisingly so, Victorian Britain was full of stiff upper lips below neatly trimmed moustaches. Controlling the Empire, and carrying the White Man's burden while snifting gin and tonics by the croquet lawn.\n<p>\nMuch as today innovation was spurred by the entrepreneur and self made man, so self development and independence, standing on ones own two feet was the order of the age.\n<p>\nAmong these pioneers was Samuel Smiles.\n\nSamuel Smiles\n<p>\n=============\n\nSmiles (1812–1904) was a Scottish author and government reformer best known for his book Self-Help (1859), which championed the idea that individual effort and perseverance were the keys to success.\n\nTrained as a doctor, Smiles later moved into journalism. He also wrote biographies of engineers and industrialists, including George Stephenson, highlighting their contributions to progress. His philosophy influenced figures like Sakichi Toyoda ( sic ), the founder of Toyota Industries.<p>\n\nNapoleon Hill<p>\n\n \n\nAnother famous early adopter was Napoleon Hill. Napoleon Hill, was one of the pioneers of modern self-help literature. His most famous book, Think and Grow Rich (1937), remains one of the best-selling personal development books of all time. Growing rich then, as now was seen to be an important goal.<p>\n\nHill’s philosophy centered on the idea that thoughts shape reality, and he emphasized principles like definiteness of purpose, persistence, and the power of a \"Mastermind\" group—a network of supportive individuals working toward a common goal.<p>\n\nCharles Atlas <p>=============<p>\n On the physical side of things, Charles Atlas was putting on his leotard and lifting weights, appealing to the 6 stone weaklings with sand in their faces. Charles Atlas (born Angelo Siciliano, 1892–1972) was an Italian-American bodybuilder and fitness pioneer best known for his Dynamic Tension training method. His famous \"97-pound weakling\" advertising campaign, which depicted a scrawny man getting sand kicked in his face before transforming into a muscular figure, became one of the most iconic self-help fitness ads of all time.\n<p>\nAtlas developed his physique through self-directed training, inspired by observing animals like lions stretching their muscles. He marketed his mail-order fitness program, which promised strength without the need for weights or gym equipment. His approach emphasized self-discipline, perseverance, and natural resistance training, aligning with broader self-help philosophies.<p>\n\nHis influence extended beyond bodybuilding—his ideas shaped modern fitness culture, inspiring generations to take control of their physical health<p>\n\nDale Carnegie <p>=============<p> For the nerds of that era, the socially inept Nigel-no-mates, there was help to be had from Dale Carnegie, so they could soon \"Win Friends and Influence People\".\n<p>\nI'll skip on over NLP, psychiatry, and related hypnosis to one of the 60's gurus the ever grinning very tall Tony Robbins.\n<p>\nIn many ways, medical self-help intersects with traditional self-improvement philosophies. Figures like Louis Kuhne, Herbert Shelton, and even Napoleon Hill emphasized the mind-body connection, arguing that health and success are linked. Today, medical self-help includes everything from functional medicine and nutrition science to psychological resilience and stress management.\n<p>\nAnthony Robbins<p> =============== Anthony Robbins, also known as Tony Robbins, is a renowned motivational speaker, life coach, and author. Born Anthony J. Mahavoric in 1960, he built a global self-help empire, inspiring millions through his seminars, books, and coaching programs2.\n<p>\nRobbins gained prominence in the 1980s, promoting Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and personal development strategies. His books, including Unlimited Power (1986) and Awaken the Giant Within (1991), emphasize mindset, goal-setting, and financial success. He has worked with celebrities, business leaders, and even U.S. presidents.\n<p>\nHis seminars often include firewalking, a technique meant to instill confidence and break mental barriers. Over the years, Robbins has expanded his focus to entrepreneurship and wealth-building, tailoring his programs to business owners and high achiever\n<p>\nTo cut a long story short ( for now )\n<p>\nModern Day Gurus\n<p>\nDeepak Chopra - A leading voice in mind-body wellness, blending Eastern philosophy with modern self-improvement.<p> Eckhart Tolle - Author of The Power of Now, focusing on mindfulness and living in the present.<p> Wayne Dyer - A pioneer in spiritual self-help, emphasizing the power of intention and personal transformation. <p>Jack Canfield - Co-author of Chicken Soup for the Soul, promoting positive thinking and resilience. <p>Tim Ferriss - Known for The 4-Hour Workweek, advocating for lifestyle design and efficiency. <p>Mel Robbins - Creator of the 5-Second Rule, helping people overcome procrastination and self-doubt.<p> Jay Shetty - Former monk turned self-help influencer, focusing on relationships and mindfulness. <p>Jordan Peterson - Psychologist and author of 12 Rules for Life, discussing responsibility and personal growth.<p> Marie Forleo - Business coach and motivational speaker, encouraging entrepreneurial success.  \n<p>\nLenses Through Which We See the World ( philosophy, psychology, personal experiences )\n<p>\nSelf help seems to have been popular forever. A while back I mooted to myself the idea of making a \"Self Help Cookbook\" (recipes for the mind), where the reader could look through the ingredients to bake their perfect cake. Maybe this is worth a blog on its own???\n<p>\nRecipes for the Mind (self-help techniques like NLP, mindfulness, resilience training)\n<p>\nEmotional Nourishment (confidence-building, stress relief, letting go techniques)\n<p>\nHistorical Wisdom (self-help lessons from figures like Samuel Smiles, Upton Sinclair, or Hale Dwoskin)\n<p>\nModern Self-Help Trends (YouTube, social media influencers, gamified self-improvement)\n<p>\nHow about including “recipes” styled like actual cooking instructions—something like “A Recipe for Overcoming Fear” with step-by-step actions.\n\n#help\n",

    "content": "Say \"fasting\" and what do you think of: Chances are you might associate the word with Islam and its famous Ramadan ritual of fasting where the believer eats no food from sun up to sun down. Otherwise maybe Buddhist monks performing ritual fasts, or Hindus. <p>Christians observe lent by giving up meat in some cases.<p>\nFasting has in recent years been revived as a medical intervention , particularly in Europe with its natural medicine traditions, doctors will often prescribe fasting to patients. <p>\nIn the modern era, fasting has returned and the big bad brother of the ketogenic diet where low blood sugar can be pretty much guaranteed. But who started the modern day practice of fasting? Enter Upton Sinclair. American Union leader, journalist and spearhead of the fasting movement in the 20th Century.\n\n<p>\n\n\n<p>\nUpton Beall Sinclair Jr. (September 20, 1878 – November 25, 1968) was an American author, muckraker journalist, and political activist, and the 1934 Democratic Party nominee for governor of California.\n<p> Prolific author and Pulitzer Prize winner, Sinclair is remember for his socialism and literature.\n<p>\n Sinclair took an interest in occult phenomena and experimented with telepathy. His book Mental Radio (1930) included accounts of his wife Mary's telepathic experiences and ability.  William McDougall read the book and wrote an introduction to it, which led him to establish the parapsychology department at Duke University. \n<p>\nSinclair was keenly interested in health and nutrition. He experimented with various diets, and with fasting. He wrote about this in his book, The Fasting Cure (1911), another bestseller.He believed that periodic fasting was important for health, saying, \"I had taken several fasts of ten or twelve days' duration, with the result of a complete making over of my health\".\n<p>\nSinclair favored a raw food diet of predominantly vegetables and nuts. For long periods of time, he was a complete vegetarian, but he also experimented with eating meat. His attitude to these matters was fully explained in the chapter, \"The Use of Meat\", in the above-mentioned book. ] In the last years of his life, Sinclair strictly ate three meals a day consisting only of brown rice, fresh fruit and celery, topped with powdered milk and salt, and pineapple juice to drink. ( lived to be 90 ).\n<p>\nHis book was somewhat of a success. he claimed to have received letters and testimonials from people who had followed his fasting cures and recovered from all sorts of illness, including heart trouble and cancer.\n\n<p>\n\nClyde Park, Mont., May 17, 1910.<p>\nDear Sir,—I was much interested\nin your article in the Cosmopolitan on\n*' Starving for Health's Sake.\" For\nsome time before I read it I had been\ntroubled with a coated tongue and a\nnasty, bitter taste in my mouth. When\nI read the article my complaint was\nprobably at its worst. I consulted a\ndoctor, who gave me some capsules to\nclean out my intestinal canal, so he\nsaid. I asked him what I could eat\nTHE FASTING CURE\nand he said, \" The less you eat the\nbetter.\" So I ate nothing for a week.\nEverything connected with my fast for\nthat week was just as you described it\n—a ravenous hunger on the second day\nand after that no hunger at all. However,\nthe coated tongue was still there,\nand when I next saw the doctor I mentioned\nyour article and said you recommended\nrectal injections.\n\n#fasting #health\n ",

    "content": " Life Through a Lens\n\nA recent chat with I can't remember who \nabout the Robbie Williams movie\n\"A Better Man\" caused me to pick a random\nRobbie track, to listen to.\n Chance threw me \"Life Thru a Lens\",\nand though it's not one his more famous efforts,\nthere was a nifty tune.\n<p>\nI wondered what it was all about? Fresh from my\nrecent bout of cinematic Robbiemania, I looked for some \n  meaning in the lyrics. It seemed obvious\nthis was about fame, publicity, image, \nphotographers, paparazzi.\n<p>\nMaybe Robbie had penned this as he was \nexperiencing the price of fame?\nWho knows? But then something else clicked, and\nit came to me that life is indeed often lived through\na lens, not literally, but metaphorically.\n<p>\nTo briefly skate over some ancient philosophies, was it\nPlato who said we live in a cave and just see the \nshadows of reality as people pass outside? \n<p>\nSome\n Buddhists dispute that there is any \"reality at all\",\nwhile another group of Buddhists believe that \"reality\" is\nall there is. Reality is what you make it, how you look\nat it.\n<p>\nMy very good friend Rob Aston, has tried to explain\nsomething similar a few times. Rob is a Zoomologist,\n who asks\nus to consider Zooming out to zoom in, to achieve the \nright perspective.<p>\nI had struggle a little with the idea what you had to zoom out,\nmaybe due to the book being called zoom-out, because sometimes\nyou need to zoom in, sometimes on a different axis. Time,\nspace etc. It suddenly fell into place, if I thought of\nlife not a being a zoomable lens but a lens in general.\n<p>\nSo, if you have a camera, you often buy many lenses, macro, zoom,\npin hole, fish eye. You may buy filters, UV, cloud filters.\nSome people see things through rose coloured glasses,\n some through a glass, darkly.\n<p>\nBeyond this we experience life through sounds, vision, touch,\nthe metaphor extends.\n<p>\nChange the lens, change the perception, change the reality.\n<p>\nHere's an example.\n<p>The Japanese tea ceremony is an ancient ritual, and through the eyes\nand experiences of a master the acts of drawing the water, heating it\nto the correct temperature etc. I remember a description of the water \nboiling though various stages, quite poetic, till it reaches fish eye\nbubbles then it is ready.\n<p>\nA physical chemist ( like me ) has a different explanation, of how water \ngoes though many liquid phases, the kinetics how it flows and heats,\nconduction, convection, radiation. The same phenomenon different lens.\n<p>\nWhat is the nature of ritual? What is the nature of ritual magik?\nCrowley's thesis, did he really communicate with Aiwass? \nOr did he meet his own subconscious? The fascinating story\nof Madam Blavatsky, Jack Parsons, the weird tale that is the\nauto hagiography of this remarkable beast.\n<p>\nRobert Anton Wilson Prometheus rising, I recall, and the inclusion\nof various exercises, \"look at the floor you will find money\".\n<p>\nBack to my old idea of the \"Self Help Cookbook\", could be now woven in,\nbut why stop there? people want help with lifestyle diet, exercise habits.\nDiet, health, medicine, politics. The camera lens and the echo chamber.\n<p>\n\"Life Though a Lens\"  would in itself be just another lens, another metaphor.\n<p>\nI don't know much about theology, philosophy, psychiatry, but it would be\nfascinating to find out.\n<p>\nThere's a lot of fruit hanging on this tree, where to pick first?<p>\n\n#magick\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Tarot is a fascinating system of symbolic imagery used for divination, self-reflection, and storytelling. A standard tarot deck consists of 78 cards, divided into the Major Arcana (22 cards) and the Minor Arcana (56 cards). The Major Arcana represents significant life themes and archetypal experiences, while the Minor Arcana is split into four suits—Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles—each corresponding to different aspects of life, such as creativity, emotions, intellect, and material concerns2.\n<p>\nEach card carries unique meanings, which can shift depending on its position in a spread and whether it appears upright or reversed. For example, The Fool symbolizes new beginnings and spontaneity, while The Magician represents manifestation and personal power. Tarot readings are often used for guidance rather than strict predictions, helping individuals explore possibilities and gain insight into their circumstances.\n#magick",

    "content": "No, it’s not about them\n\nI don’t know what the prefix “eu” means, but I think it might be greek. It seems to be used for something that’s good like “euphoria”, that’s good isn’t it? Well, no, not always. It’s a long story, but many years ago I “suffered” a bout of euphoria that would not go away. Well, it’s great at first, who wouldn’t enjoy that? But after a while it became a bit embarrassing, people saying “what you smiling at?”. This only applied realy to people who had known the miserable old me as strangers just assumed I was a jolly good fellow.\n\nA dentist told me he thought I may have a brain tumor!!! They used to be “mister” then they became “doctor” and got big headed.\n\nIt had come overnight, with no “by your leave”, and yes, it was pretty nice. But after a while it got tedious and also exhausting. It was like manic depression where people get mood swings but without the depression. I did try looking on the internet, but couldn’t find anything. ( btw I have had low cholesterol all my life, and tried to get info on that but all I got was advice on how to lower my cholesterol . Fat lot of use that ). But I digress. Rest assured after a few months I did manage to return to normal, but I still have low cholesterol.\n\nRight. the “eu” prefix is when they are trying to sell you on something good, like “euphoria” or “euthanasia” or “European Union” ( I didn’t vote btw ). And “eugenics”.\n\nIt’s a movement that promoted selective breeding of human beings. This was to get rid of some inherited diseases, or to improve the human race by only good looking people or really smart people could breed. I never understood all the details, but you can see how it may be a “good thing”. It was started by the greeks , but got really popular in the 1920’s. People like George Bernard Shaw and Adolphe Hitler. It was quite a respectable point of view until Hitler got involved then it was mostly thought of as a “bad thing”.\n\nIt’s a fact, I think, that most modern farm animals are very different from the mark one version. Maybe the\nprehistoric cow had tiny udders and thin milk. Roll on a few hundred generations an “Voilà!” gold top milk. Skinny pigs become “Danishhhhhh”. And so on. The modern border collie was whipped up in just a few hundred years, now they are as smart as a pin.\n\nAldous Huxley wrote “Brave New World”, ( as did Billy Shakespeare ), about a dystopian future where people were put into different classes. Alpha, beta etc. I can see people in the bottom classes objecting to eugenics, who wants to be in the bottom class? Huxley also wrote “Island”, which is about a Utopia, ( should be Eutopia shouldn’t it? ). And another thing, if two smart people get married and have a child the sprog is likely to be less intelligent than its parents. If two dullards do the same then the kid is smarter, thus increasing the average IQ of the race. Maybe that’s why eugenics never took off.\n\nAnyway, I’ve pretty much posted what I intended to. A bit of a first eh?\n\n",
