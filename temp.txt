   There are quite a few words that can be classified as “one trick words”, i.e. they are always 
   ( or almost always ) found in conjunction with another given word. i.e. did you ever hear of a 
   toothcomb that wasn’t fine? You may have been cheesed off, but who was ever cheesed on? 
   You get the idea.\nI first came across the term many years ago on a website “richard.tangle-wood.uk”
    which I would assume was a personal page that Richard tacked onto a company website so he didn’t need
     to pay for, what with in those days internet use being somewhat expensive.
      This page no longer exists along with a few other wordplay type pages that Richard had made. 
      So credit Richard, it’s only fair, but I’ve tried to make a definitive list from his 
      and other sources, along with a few trivial amendments here’s my “definitive list”.
